We will interact with both and use the various components of RStudio. 1.1.1 What is R? R is an environment for statistical computing and graphics. RStudio is an editor or integrated development environment (IDE) that makes working with R much more comfortable. To install R and RStudio on your computer, download both from the following sources: Download R from The Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) Download RStudio from RStudio.com Keep both R and RStudio up to date. That means go online and check for newer versions. In case there are new versions, download those and re-install. 1.1.2 RStudio Let’s get acquainted with R. When you start RStudio for the first time, you’ll see three panes: 1.1.3 Console The Console in RStudio is the simplest way to interact with R. You can type some code at the Console and when you press ENTER, R will run that code. Depending on what you type, you may see some output in the Console or if you make a mistake, you may get a warning or an error message. Let’s familiarize ourselves with the console by using R as a simple calculator: 2 + 4 [1] 6 Now that we know how to use the + sign for addition, let’s try some other mathematical operations such as subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/). 10 - 4 [1] 6 5 * 3 [1] 15 7 / 2 [1] 3.5 You can use the cursor or arrow keys on your keyboard to edit your code at the console:- Use the UP and DOWN keys to re-run something without typing it again- Use the LEFT and RIGHT keys to edit Take a few minutes to play around at the console and try different things out. Don’t worry if you make a mistake, you can’t break anything easily! 1.1.4 Scripts The Console is great for simple tasks but if you’re working on a project you would mostly likely want to save your work in some sort of a document or a file. Scripts in R are just plain text files that contain R code. You can edit a script just like you would edit a file in any word processing or note-taking application. Create a new script using the menu or the toolbar button as shown below. Once you’ve created a script, it is generally a good idea to give it a meaningful name and save it immediately. For our first session save your script as seminar1.R Familiarize yourself with the script window in RStudio, and especially the two buttons labeled Run and Source There are a few different ways to run your code from a script. One line at a time Place the cursor on the line you want to run and hit CTRL-ENTER or use the Run button Multiple lines Select the lines you want to run and hit CTRL-ENTER or use the Run button Entire script Use the Source button "]
