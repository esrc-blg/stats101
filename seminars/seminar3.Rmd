# Creating and Exploring Data Frames

```{r, include = FALSE}
par(bg = '#fdf6e3')
```

## Seminar

In this session we introduce data frames using R-syntax.

### Clearing your workspace from previous work

To remove a specific object or in this case a matrix, we can use the following command.

```{r}
ls()
rm(mat1)
```

Otherwise we can remove everything, which is good practice when starting new work. The same can also be achieved by clicking on the yellow broomstick in the Enviornemnt and Files Panel in R Studio (top right hand panel)

```{r}
rm( list = ls() )
```

### Creating data frames

A data frame is an object that holds data in a tabular format similar to how spreadsheets work. Variables are generally kept in columns and observations are in rows. Data frames are similar to matrices but they can store vectors of different types (e.g. numbers and text).

We start by creating a data frame with the `data.frame()` function. We will give each column a name (a variable name) followed by the `=` operator and the respective vector of data that we want to assign to that column.

```{r}
england <- data.frame(
  name = c("South East", "London", "North West", "East of England", "West Midlands", "South West",
           "Yorkshire and the Humber", "East Midlands", "North East"),
  population = c(8.6, 8.2, 7.1, 5.9, 5.6, 5.3, 5.3, 4.5, 2.6),
  earnings = c(28.7, 35.1, 25.2, 26.6, 24.9, 25.6, 25, 25, 25)
)
```

We can also display the entire dataset in spreadsheet view by clicking on the object name in the environment window.

### Working with data frames

we can display the entire dataset in spreadsheet view by clicking on the object name in the environment window.


Alternatively, you can call the object name to display the dataset in the console window. Let's do so:

```{r}
england
```

Often, datasets are too long to be viewed to in the console window. It is a good idea to look at the first couple of rows of a datasets to get an overview of its contents. We use the square brackets `[]` to view the first five rows and all columns.

```{r}
england[1:5, ]
```
v
Columns in a dataframe have names. We will often need to know the name of a column/variable to access it. We use the `names()` function to view all variable names in a dataframe.

```{r}
names(england)
```

We can access the earnings variable in multiple ways. First, we can use the `$` operator. We write the name of the dataset object, followed by the `$`, followed by the variable name like so:

```{r}
england$population
```

We can also use the square brackets to access the earnings column. 

```{r}
england[, "population" ]
```

The square brackets are sometimes preferred because we could access multiple columns at once like so:

```{r}
england[, c("name", "population") ]
```

You can also explore the variable further. For instance, calculate the average population in England and then select regions that have a population higher than this average. Again the dataset object is followed by the `$`and then the variable name like so

```{r}
mean(england$population)
avg.pop = mean(england$population)
england [england$population > avg.pop,
         c("name", "population")]
```

Variables come in different types such as numbers, text, logical (true/false). We need to know the type of a variable because the type affects statistical analysis. We use the `str()` function to check the type of each variable in our dataset.

```{r}
str(england)
```

The first variable in our dataset is a factor variable. Factors are categorical variables. Categories are mutually exclusive but they do not imply an ordering. For instance, "East of England" is not more or less than "West Midlands". The variables population and earnings are both numeric variables.
